# The Method of Nourish Spirit with Eyes Closed

1. Rest with eyes closed ( <— the key point lies entirely in these four words).  
2. Observe naturally in stillness (observe the natural changes of spirit consciousness as a bystander).  
3. When the spirit is sufficient, it will go out by itself.  
4. When the spirit is tired, it will also go out by itself (after going out, it will nourish itself).  
5. If the spirit is neither insufficient nor tired, it will not go out by itself, but will turn into daydreaming.  
6. Within daydreaming, it then transforms into the going out of spirit, which is the same as lucidly going out in dreams in the “Dream Observation Method.”

The starting point of this method:  
It is based on Laozi’s “True Dao Nourishes the Spirit.”  
Later, it was integrated with Naropa’s *“The Dream Yoga of Accomplishment”* from India — “becoming lucid within the dream and transforming into the out-of-body state” — and Lü Chunyang’s *“The Secret of the Golden Flower”* from China — “the spirit wanders in dreams.”  
By artificially creating a daydream, one is guided into the out-of-body state.

— It is the simplest and most direct essence distilled from among hundreds of methods.

This method may appear overly simple, and may be difficult to accept for modern people who pursue complexity.  
However, after sincere experimentation, one will find that the Great Way is indeed simple.  
On the surface it may seem too simple, even false — yet when one goes deeper, the reality is the exact opposite.

Laozi also used this method, even in a simpler form.
