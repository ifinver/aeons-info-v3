## Step One: Replenishing the Body and Sealing the Leaks — Gaining the Fruit of Dispelling Illness and Extending Life

### (A) Rationale for Replenishing the Body

When a human being is in the mother’s womb, a single spark of numinous nature receives the mother’s *qi and blood to be gestated. After ten months, separation from the mother completes the human form. From age one to about sixteen, *yang‑qi is abundant and the dantian is full. At times when qi reaches the Yang Pass, the external genitals are stirred and sexual desires arise. Once one has sexual intercourse, the primordial yang stored up over more than ten years begins to leak away. When this leak is opened, it is most difficult to close again. As time goes on, the body’s essence is constantly lost through this aperture (when essence departs, original qi follows). Thus the body becomes a depleted shell within. Beaten by wind and rain, assailed by cold and heat, invaded by disease, decline and death draw near. This is why people cannot attain longevity.

Because the rationale for replenishing the body is as stated above, we value the corresponding method. This method is applied to a body already leaking, so that the orifice through which leakage occurs is closed again, and the essence already lost is replenished. When essence is full and qi is abundant, the replenishing work is complete: the spirit becomes bright, the body robust, diseases do not invade, and longevity is naturally obtained. This is the first step in the cultivation of the True Way.

### (B) Instructions for Replenishing the Body

For one whose body is already leaking, whenever sexual desire is stirred, the essence‑qi in the body rushes straight to the Yang Pass; the external genitals become erect and follow the natural reproductive course. This is also Nature’s mechanism and not merely human intention. In learning sitting meditation, the first priority is to value essence and qi and not allow external leakage; only then can the body be replenished.
1. During sitting, first settle the posture (details below). Next, sincerely place intention in the lower dantian. That is one.
2. Firmly restrain stray thoughts. That is two.
3. Use the eyes to look inward—this is the so‑called “turning the light around”—to the lower dantian. That is three.
4. Do not overexert attention; it suffices that there is constant, gentle awareness of the lower dantian. That is four.
5. At the very start of a session, hold firmly to this aim and persist with resolve; do not stop until results appear. That is five.
6. For beginners, breathing will naturally be uneven; do not emphasize or manipulate the breath so that mind and qi become unnatural (caution). If you constantly keep sincere intention in the lower dantian, the breath will gradually deepen and even out by itself. That is six.
7. In sitting, do not over‑fixate, and do not lapse into indifference. That is seven.
8. Over‑fixation falls into “being”; indifference falls into “emptiness.” Both miss the Way (caution). You must imagine that all things are “not‑there” (wu). Even your body is not felt as “there.” Only a single point of sincere intention is kept in the lower dantian—neither leaning nor slanting, without thought or deliberation. This accords with the Way of sitting. That is eight.
9. At the beginning, the above essentials are often hard to accomplish all at once—proceed gradually (caution). When stray thoughts suddenly arise, your sincere intention has already wandered (caution). Quickly gather intention back to the lower dantian and stray thoughts will naturally extinguish. That is nine.
10. If suddenly you see illusory images of people, flowers, or grasses, your sincere intention has become obscure (caution). Re‑inspect and brighten intention; the images will vanish. That is ten.

For beginners, a session of half an hour to one hour is appropriate. With time, extend to one to two hours. If there is no sense of hardship, you may lengthen further. Pure work yields quick results; scant work yields slow results—choose accordingly. The ancients often sat four times daily at Zi, Wu, Mao, and You (midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk). About three months of such practice can complete the replenishing of the body (caution). Because of differences in bodily strength and correctness of method, results may come sooner or later.

After about a month of sitting, the mind becomes calm and the breath harmonious. Gradually the lower dantian feels a subtle vibration. Warm fluid in the chest gradually descends to the lower dantian; the lower field becomes warm and then vibrates, spreading through the body to the four limbs. The blood along the Governing Vessel rises up the back, passes the Jade Pillow, upper field, Bright Hall, the Magpie Bridge, the Many‑Storied Tower, and reaches the Yellow Court.

This is blood circulation and differs from the passage of yang‑essence through the gates into the Yellow Court—understand the distinction in your heart. Gradually, the blood can be gathered at will into the lower dantian (when intention is kept, qi and blood surge; when intention disperses, qi and blood scatter. Only after long sitting can the whole body’s qi and blood obey intention). The lower field becomes extraordinarily warm; the kidneys within feel as if boiling; warmth passes through the testicles; before the eyes there is light like electricity. Jade Nectar wells under the tongue; there is rumbling at the back of the head; the vessels open; the external genitals no longer rise; the Yang Pass closes tightly; child‑like purity returns; qi is sufficient, the body light, eyes bright, ears keen; diseases do not invade. Thus is obtained the fruit of longevity.

## Step Two: Practising the Method of Changing the Body — Attaining the Fruit of Long Life and Deathlessness

### (A) Rationale for Changing the Body

When essence and qi are sufficient, the true yang‑qi of the lower field will seek a route and flow elsewhere. Rising from the lower field, it crosses the Lower Magpie Bridge, enters the Tail Gate, passes the Three Passes, goes through the upper field to the Bright Hall, crosses the Upper Magpie Bridge, descends past the Many‑Storied Tower, and reaches the Yellow Court. Circulating gradually through the Governing, Conception, and Thoroughfare vessels, it moistens the whole body and irrigates the hundred bones. Yang increases while yin decreases. In six to seven months, or in nine to ten months, yang‑qi may fill the whole body; the skin and flesh shine, the spirit is clear, appetite diminishes, and great stability is attained.

At this stage, qi is yang‑qi, blood is yang‑fluid, and within the bones there is yang‑substance. Wind and rain cannot invade; cold and heat cannot penetrate. The body of longevity is thus formed. What the alchemical classics call “passing the passes and taking nourishment” refers to this very matter. Yet this is not yet an indestructible body, for it still has form and can be damaged. To seek freedom from transmigration forever, one must, upon completing this second step, proceed to the third.

### (B) Instructions for Changing the Body

When replenishing is complete, a mass of yang‑qi fills the lower field, warm like spring day and night. The classics call this the Great Medicine—also “external elixir.” Even so, continue sitting as before; do not allow the slightest self‑congratulation.
11. When yang‑qi is full and the dantian cannot contain it, it moves like a fire‑pearl, seeking apertures elsewhere. If it rises upward it oppresses the heart and cannot expand, so it rushes downward to the Yang Pass and charges straight to the external genitals, which feel a response. At this time tightly close the Yang Pass and do not allow external leakage. That is eleven.
12. When the Yang Pass is closed, the qi passes the Lower Magpie Bridge and turns toward the Valley Path (anus). Tightly close the Valley Path to prevent leakage. That is twelve.
13. With the Valley Path closed, the qi reaches outside the Tail Gate (coccyx). Now guide it with intention so that it passes the Tail Gate. That is thirteen. (The Tail Gate is the old route of yang‑qi. Because once the Yang Pass opened, essence leaked outward, it has long not passed by the Tail Gate; thus this gate has long been blocked.)
14. Sometimes the fire‑timing (work) is insufficient (sincere intention is like fire—wherever intention reaches, there is fire; the “firing times” of the classics refer to the action of sincerity). If yang‑qi is not sufficient, it may reach the Tail Gate but lack strength to pass through. Do not force it. Return intention to the lower dantian, sit as before, and generate it anew. That is fourteen.
15. When the mechanism rises again like a fire‑pearl to the Tail Gate, again guide it with intention to pass. That is fifteen.
16. After one or several attempts, there will surely come a time of passage. Once through the Tail Gate, the heat reaches the Spinal Pass; again seek to pass through—this is the second pass. That is sixteen.
17. If it can pass, let it pass; if not, return intention to the lower field and sit as before, awaiting sufficient qi. That is seventeen.
18. Then guide it with intention again. That is eighteen.
19. Once through the Spinal Pass, the mass of heat reaches the Jade Pillow—this is the third pass. Guide it with intention through the Jade Pillow to enter the upper field. That is nineteen.
20. If it can pass, let it pass; if not, return intention to the lower field and await the moment, as with the two passes above. That is twenty.
21. With the three passes open, guide the heat through the Bright Hall, over the Upper Magpie Bridge, down through the left and right valleys of the mouth, straight past the Many‑Storied Tower, arriving at the Yellow Court. That is twenty‑one. (When yang‑qi passes an orifice it may rush to the nostrils as a way of venting. At the Upper Magpie Bridge and before the Lower Magpie Bridge are dangerous zones—caution, caution!)
22. From the lower dantian, Yang Pass, Lower Magpie Bridge, Valley Path, Tail Gate, Spinal Pass, Jade Pillow, upper dantian, Bright Hall, to the Yellow Court—the Conception and Governing vessels become fully open, and the work of “passing the passes and taking nourishment” is complete. (What the classics call yang‑qi descending through the Many‑Storied Tower to the Yellow Court is “taking nourishment.”) At this point, change the method of sitting; it can no longer be the same as before. (From here begins the time of firing for the Great Circulation.) In sitting, “passing the passes and taking nourishment” is the pivotal key. To this point, half the Great Way is attained. Now only keep the intention soft and unbroken, ever‑present and never scattered. That is twenty‑two.
23. Not only during sitting, but also while walking, eating, and sleeping, do not let sincere intention slip for even a moment. If intention scatters, yang‑qi will not arise—like a pot on the stove: when the fire is strong the steam is strong; when the fire goes out there is no steam. Intention is the fire; this is no arbitrary metaphor. The classics say: “Water fears dryness (water means essence‑qi); fire fears cold (fire means sincerity).” That is twenty‑three.

Passing the passes and taking nourishment marks the transition between replenishing the body and changing the body. After the passes have been opened and nourishment taken, keep intention ever‑present so that the ancestral yang, the original qi, arises continually, flowing from the main channel into the branches and from the branches throughout the whole body. Day by day it irrigates and supplements. Then the body’s yin diminishes and yang gradually fills. When yang fills the whole body, the skin, muscles, and bones will have transformed. Naturally you will be free of hunger and thirst, grow weary of worldly flavors, the body emanates a subtle fragrance, you are neither cold nor hot, sleep drops away, and in stillness the qi comes to rest—great stability is achieved. Thus the work of changing the body is complete.

## Step Three: Practising Spirit Egress — Attaining the Fruit of Casting Off the Sheath

### (A) Rationale for Spirit Egress

When the work of changing the body is complete, one can fast and enter deep samadhi. In samadhi, there is bright clarity and only a single mass of nature‑qi—the internal elixir. The internal elixir is the yang spirit, the so‑called “true I.” Seeing this one thing is seeing one’s nature—truly knowing oneself. This yang spirit is nourished by ancestral qi; the ancestral qi within also grows by nourishing the yang spirit—like a woman’s qi and blood nourishing an infant. The difference is that the infant grows in a woman’s womb by the course of nature, whereas the yang spirit grows into an immortal body within a man by reversal. The infant’s birth and the yang spirit’s emergence from the shell are both natural principles.

When the yang spirit emerges, the third step is reached, the true fruit attained, the great matter accomplished (the golden body). Above, one is no longer manipulated by yin and yang; below, one is not threatened by weapons, water, or fire. One may fly to the Ninth Heaven, traverse ten thousand miles in an instant; one’s radiance shines with sun and moon; one’s lifespan endures with the vast void. Gathered, it forms a body; scattered, it becomes qi. Its powers are vast and transformations beyond measure. Yet there remains a fourth step; at the top of the hundred‑foot pole, one must take one more step so that nothing is left undone.

### (B) Instructions for Spirit Egress

With the work of changing the body accomplished, essence‑qi fills the whole body and great stability is present.
24. “Great stability” is when vast emptiness prevails and even breathing comes to rest. Now regulate and allow the spirit to exit the shell; do not keep it long constrained within. Nourishment is complete; it must emerge. This is natural; therefore do not worry it will not come out, nor strive to force it out. If the yang spirit is not yet pure, no method can draw it outside. Thus at the time of spirit egress, return the single point of sincere intention to reflect upon the middle and lower fields so that yang‑qi arises and supplements the fetal spirit. That is twenty‑four.
25. When the fetal spirit is full—clear and bright like the moon at mid‑heaven (if there is even the slightest turbidity, the fetal spirit is not complete)—in sitting there will suddenly appear flake‑like shapes like falling snow before the eyes. This is the time of spirit egress. That is twenty‑five.
26. Now move the spirit to the upper field and imagine yourself ascending from the Mud‑Ball Palace up into the heavens. That is twenty‑six.
27. After repeated imagining and intentional guidance, if it can exit, let it exit; if it cannot, return to reflect upon the middle and lower fields and await the occasion. That is twenty‑seven.
28. When the moment arrives, guide it as above; after a time, spirit egress will occur. When the yang spirit has emerged, there is a body outside the body—the so‑called Dharma‑body—indestructible over kalpas. At this stage, success is achieved; there is no more wheel of rebirth and one becomes a supreme Perfected. Yet do not at once fly off after egress; continue the work of nurturing. Therefore, once the yang spirit emerges, immediately draw it back. That is twenty‑eight.
29. After withdrawing it, again regulate and allow spirit egress. That is twenty‑nine.
30. Train in this way daily. In time, it becomes at your command. During this period of sitting, keep the spirit only in the upper field. That is thirty.
31. After the yang spirit leaves the body, many powers appear. Do not delight in them or display radiance outward. Embrace the Way serenely and cultivate with care. That is thirty‑one.
32. When the yang spirit exits, do not go far at first. Exit a step or two, then immediately retract. Next time go twenty steps, then retract. From near to far, proceed day by day, and there will be no danger of loss or confusion. That is thirty‑two.

After three years of such training, the yang spirit becomes skilled and free—able to travel millions of miles with no concern. Thereafter, one may either retire to famed mountains, undertaking nine years of wall‑gazing, or dwell among the world to aid beings and accumulate merit, greatly brightening one’s future.

## Step Four: Practising Returning to Emptiness — Attaining the Fruit of Union with the True Void

### (A) Rationale for Returning to Emptiness

When the yang spirit is matured, nature and life are both set aright; there is no peril of birth and death. If one stops here, the Way is not yet exhausted. The yang spirit is formed from the union of one’s numinous nature and ancestral qi. Though formless, it still has the character of qi and is limited to the realm of ancestral qi; it cannot surpass into the domain of the Void to unite with the Origin of True Emptiness. The Buddha‑Dharma is vast beyond bounds; Laozi in the Thirty‑Three Heavens—these all point to the utmost of the Dao.

After spirit egress, in addition to “nursing for three years,” one must still undertake “nine years of wall‑gazing,” so that the nature of qi is entirely dissolved and merged with the Great Void—until the void itself is my body and my body is the void. Far beyond the realm of ancestral qi, reaching the “Primordial Emptiness of the Origin,” one arrives at the ultimate. Otherwise, like Sun Wukong, a single somersault of 108,000 li still never leaves the palm of the Tathagata.

### (B) Instructions for Returning to Emptiness

Though the yang spirit has left the body, the work is not finished. From sitting to spirit egress is wrought by method and may proceed too swiftly; former habits are hard to erase. One may have an indestructible body yet not an unchanging nature—life is completed but nature not exhausted. Therefore, after spirit egress, continue sitting.
33. The posture remains as before, but keep the single point of the yang spirit’s numinosity in the upper field—upright, centered, neither leaning nor deviating. That is thirty‑three.
34. Gradually, do not even hold to “the Center,” and let “methods” fall away—keep only a single expanse of pure clarity merging with the Great Void. That is thirty‑four.
35. Gradually, even the Great Void is not held; the true and the void merge as one. That is thirty‑five.
36. Void upon void, nothing upon nothing; emptiness to the point where there is no more that can be emptied—only then is the utmost reached. That is thirty‑six.

At this time, Emptiness is your original nature; your original nature is united with Emptiness. The numinous body is utterly refined—now beyond even “ancestral qi.” To walk the Way to this point is called “above the utmost”; to establish one’s person to this point is “before the before.” At the very end, the work is truly round and the fruit complete.

## Appendix: Brief Explanations of Daoist Terms

The Three Fields (dantian), Three Passes, Three Vessels, Two Bridges, Bright Hall, Many‑Storied Tower, Yang Pass, Valley Path, and Bubbling Spring are all apertures and pathways through which blood and essence‑qi circulate.

Although sitting appears to be non‑action, in Zhuangzi’s sense of “non‑action yet nothing left undone,” within stillness there is great functioning—it is not like dead wood and cold ashes.
