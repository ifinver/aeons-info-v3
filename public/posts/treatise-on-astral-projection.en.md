# Treatise on Astral Projection

## About the Author

**Robert Bruce** is an internationally respected mystic, paranormal researcher, and metaphysical experimenter. Since 1992, he has generously shared guidance online. He is warm-hearted, deeply humble, full of compassion, sincerity, and humor.

He was born in the UK and now resides in Sydney. For over twenty-five years, Robert has delved into the mechanics, kinetics, and dynamics of the supernatural—especially out-of-body experiences (OBEs), the energy body, kundalini, clairvoyance, healing, psychic crime and defense, psychic attack, and self-protection.

His published works include *Astral Dynamics* and *Capturing the Glow* (co-authored). He is currently working on several new books and manuals. Some of his early works are available on his website.

He discusses his astral experiences and the meanings behind them. He also explores higher worlds and the material world we live in. He offers many unique insights into these realms.

Robert Bruce is a pioneer of the new age we are now entering. His research shows that astral projection is far more than a novelty. It demands great sensitivity, courage, and flexibility to face and integrate these new realities. Humanity has never ceased exploring the world—and it is very likely that the astral planes are our next frontier.

Bruce believes that the out-of-body experience can help transform our concept of death into a realization of the eternal nature of life. Following his step-by-step techniques, one may even encounter multiple selves inhabiting different slices of space-time!

## Part One

### Chapter One: The Basic Concept of Astral Projection


This is the first part of a series describing the astral world and the process of projection.

While reading this treatise, keep in mind that this was my first attempt at writing. You could say I learned as I went along.

For most of my life, I have studied the astral planes through my own astral body. I have tried to understand it through careful observation and serious thought, and I hope to uncover its mysteries.

Without exception, everyone leaves their body during sleep in a low-powered projection. I call this "sleep projection." Like a balloon tied to a string, the astral body hovers a few inches above the physical body, mimicking its sleeping posture and not straying far. Once out of the body, the astral body is free to create dreams. This is the familiar process of sleep and dreaming. During this time, you sink into a shared dream-consciousness of the world. This dream world is divided into several levels. Depending on your personality—spiritual, moral, etc.—you tune your awareness to a corresponding level. These are often called "planes" or subplanes. That terminology is fine, but it may be confusing when trying to grasp the entire concept.

During sleep projection, if you can perceive it with the same awareness as a lucid dream, you can exert a certain level of control and move through different planes. However, if you have control but cannot return to the real world, and cannot function in it using the astral body, then you are in the dream world or astral plane’s inverted realm—where anything is possible, but nothing is quite real.

When you achieve a "fully conscious" projection of the astral body, you are projecting into the real-time physical world—not the astral plane. This has long been misunderstood. What most people today call "astral projection" is more accurately described as lucid dreaming. They are not the same.

Many authors claim that we travel through the universe each night in astral projection. This is not accurate. When you're in the astral body, the physical world is a lonely place—you rarely see others projecting. And if you do see anyone, they are usually just standing around, stunned, caught in a middle state between projection and creation. In conscious OBE, this happens when you lose control. I call this the “Alice-in-Wonderland Effect.”

This serves as a strong barrier for the untrained mind.

The astral body possesses incredible creative power, typically used for dream generation. Once free from physical limitations, you can create an entire world—and you often do. This creative power is at the heart of many misunderstandings about astral projection.

Astral projection has a built-in barrier, just like all other forms of psychic ability.

In most cases, the "Alice" effect limits real-world projection to just a few minutes, unless you can fully control your consciousness and energy levels. Without that barrier, imagine the chaos: people flying around all day and night with no privacy or secrets. That would be a disturbing world.

So what happens during a fully conscious astral projection if you can't control your consciousness and energy? At some point, you’ll begin to lose grip on your experience. Familiar things will appear in the wrong places—doors, windows, furniture, or extra rooms. Your subconscious is starting to create, or you're tuning into a level of the dream world. Once that happens, it becomes impossible to tell what’s real. Some levels of the dream world are exact copies of the real world. You may tune into one and believe you’re projecting into the physical world—until you meet a grinning cat.

One final point: the Eastern concept of levels—physical, astral, mental, Buddhic, Atmic, etc.—is quite real. But these are different levels of consciousness, not the same as the planes described here. When you project astrally, your consciousness doesn't rise—it remains the same as when awake. Only by raising your consciousness can you reach those “higher” levels, and you cannot project into them. That is a different kind of “projection.” I have been to those higher levels, but explaining them is difficult—you must experience them yourself. These levels are typically reached through deep meditation.

To access these higher levels, you need clairvoyance—a faculty that can be developed or may be innate.

### Chapter Two: Conditions for Astral Projection and Relaxation Exercises

Astral projection is an automatic reflex of your body and consciousness. Triggering a fully conscious projection requires meeting three primary conditions:

- The ability to completely relax the body while remaining mentally awake.  
- The ability to shift your point of consciousness outside your body.  
- Sufficient mental and spiritual energy to maintain control over the projection without slipping into sleep.

Combined, these conditions initiate the automatic projection reflex with enough momentum to cause a full projection. There are also secondary conditions that may vary depending on your experience and environment.

#### *Relaxation*

You must **master** full-body relaxation. If you already know a relaxation method, you may adapt it. Sit in a **chair** and begin relaxing. Start from your feet: tense and then relax them. Continue by tensing and relaxing your calves, thighs, hips, abdomen, chest, arms, neck, and face. Repeat this process several times until you feel completely relaxed. Breathe deeply and slowly throughout, and try to **perceive** the breath entering and leaving your body.

#### *Imaginary Hands"*

Imagine having a pair of **Imaginary Hands**. Use these hands to stroke yourself repeatedly, starting from your feet and moving up your thighs. Try to **feel** them relaxing you and giving comfort. Continue stroking your torso, paying special attention to the chakras. The Imaginary Hands technique also trains you to shift your point of consciousness to various parts of the body. Focus your full attention on these Imaginary Hands as much as possible.

#### *Energy Raising*

While using your Imaginary Hands to stroke your thighs upward, imagine that you are grabbing the energy flowing there and pushing it upward. This is the natural channel of psychic/life energy flowing within your body. With practice, you will **actually feel** this energy surging through you. It acts like a battery that **recharges** you.

#### *Chakras*

These chakras are located at:

1. **Base Chakra** – at the base of the spine (between anus and genitals)  
2. **Spleen Chakra** – just below the navel  
3. **Solar Plexus Chakra** – a palm’s width above the navel  
4. **Heart Chakra** – center of the chest  
5. **Throat Chakra**  
6. **Brow Chakra**  
7. **Crown Chakra** – at the crown of the head

Visualize each chakra as roughly the size of your hand.

#### *Chakra Activation*

Chakras are energy transmutation centers. Each chakra converts the Earth's natural life energy into a specific type of energy. As you push energy upward with your Imaginary Hands, pause briefly at each chakra and visualize your Imaginary Hands **opening** it. Push energy from one chakra to the next. Repeat this process several times. You may not feel anything at first, but with practice, you’ll begin to sense a pulsing or vibration beneath your skin.

#### *Check Yourself*

During the entire session, continually check for muscle tension. If needed, redo the relaxation steps. A common issue is that muscles will **automatically tense** when you raise energy. Remember—these are mental actions only. Your physical body must remain still and deeply relaxed.

#### *Shifting the Point of Consciousness*

To shift your point of consciousness, imagine yourself one or two feet in front of your physical body—not as a separate person, but as yourself located ahead of your body. Always remember that your body is behind you. It may feel strange at first, but you'll get used to it. Do not tense up or let your body attempt to follow—your body will try to obey, physically. Don’t let it.

#### *Mental State*

Your surface mind will be fully occupied by these exercises, so no mental effort is needed to stay focused. As you relax, your body will begin to feel **heavy**, and you’ll enter a light **trance** state. Stop other exercises at this point, and use **breath awareness** to clear your mind of distractions.

#### *Breath Awareness*

**Perceive** the air as you inhale and exhale. As you breathe in, use your Imaginary Hands to push energy from the base chakra up to the heart chakra. **Note**: If vibrations start and you’re not ready to project yet, gently shake your head and move slightly to maintain normal awareness.

These exercises should be practiced **daily**. Whenever you have a few spare minutes, do a few of them. You will quickly and easily rebalance your physical condition. With regular practice, you’ll be able to enter a state of **complete relaxation** within minutes. When attempting full conscious projection, this training will greatly reduce effort and fatigue.
