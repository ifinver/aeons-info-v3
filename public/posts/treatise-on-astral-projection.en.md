## About the Author

**Robert Bruce** is an internationally respected mystic, paranormal researcher, and metaphysical experimenter. Since 1992, he has generously shared guidance online. He is warm-hearted, deeply humble, full of compassion, sincerity, and humor.

He was born in the UK and now resides in Sydney. For over twenty-five years, Robert has delved into the mechanics, kinetics, and dynamics of the supernatural—especially out-of-body experiences (OBEs), the energy body, kundalini, clairvoyance, healing, psychic crime and defense, psychic attack, and self-protection.

His published works include *Astral Dynamics* and *Capturing the Glow* (co-authored). He is currently working on several new books and manuals. Some of his early works are available on his website.

He discusses his astral experiences and the meanings behind them. He also explores higher worlds and the material world we live in. He offers many unique insights into these realms.

Robert Bruce is a pioneer of the new age we are now entering. His research shows that astral projection is far more than a novelty. It demands great sensitivity, courage, and flexibility to face and integrate these new realities. Humanity has never ceased exploring the world—and it is very likely that the astral planes are our next frontier.

Bruce believes that the out-of-body experience can help transform our concept of death into a realization of the eternal nature of life. Following his step-by-step techniques, one may even encounter multiple selves inhabiting different slices of space-time!

## Part One

### Chapter One: The Basic Concept of Astral Projection

This is the first part of a series describing the astral world and the process of projection.

While reading this treatise, keep in mind that this was my first attempt at writing. You could say I learned as I went along.

For most of my life, I have studied the astral planes through my own astral body. I have tried to understand it through careful observation and serious thought, and I hope to uncover its mysteries.

Without exception, everyone leaves their body during sleep in a low-powered projection. I call this "sleep projection." Like a balloon tied to a string, the astral body hovers a few inches above the physical body, mimicking its sleeping posture and not straying far. Once out of the body, the astral body is free to create dreams. This is the familiar process of sleep and dreaming. During this time, you sink into a shared dream-consciousness of the world. This dream world is divided into several levels. Depending on your personality—spiritual, moral, etc.—you tune your awareness to a corresponding level. These are often called "planes" or subplanes. That terminology is fine, but it may be confusing when trying to grasp the entire concept.

During sleep projection, if you can perceive it with the same awareness as a lucid dream, you can exert a certain level of control and move through different planes. However, if you have control but cannot return to the real world, and cannot function in it using the astral body, then you are in the dream world or astral plane’s inverted realm—where anything is possible, but nothing is quite real.

When you achieve a "fully conscious" projection of the astral body, you are projecting into the real-time physical world—not the astral plane. This has long been misunderstood. What most people today call "astral projection" is more accurately described as lucid dreaming. They are not the same.

Many authors claim that we travel through the universe each night in astral projection. This is not accurate. When you're in the astral body, the physical world is a lonely place—you rarely see others projecting. And if you do see anyone, they are usually just standing around, stunned, caught in a middle state between projection and creation. In conscious OBE, this happens when you lose control. I call this the “Alice-in-Wonderland Effect.”

This serves as a strong barrier for the untrained mind.

The astral body possesses incredible creative power, typically used for dream generation. Once free from physical limitations, you can create an entire world—and you often do. This creative power is at the heart of many misunderstandings about astral projection.

Astral projection has a built-in barrier, just like all other forms of psychic ability.

In most cases, the "Alice" effect limits real-world projection to just a few minutes, unless you can fully control your consciousness and energy levels. Without that barrier, imagine the chaos: people flying around all day and night with no privacy or secrets. That would be a disturbing world.

So what happens during a fully conscious astral projection if you can't control your consciousness and energy? At some point, you’ll begin to lose grip on your experience. Familiar things will appear in the wrong places—doors, windows, furniture, or extra rooms. Your subconscious is starting to create, or you're tuning into a level of the dream world. Once that happens, it becomes impossible to tell what’s real. Some levels of the dream world are exact copies of the real world. You may tune into one and believe you’re projecting into the physical world—until you meet a grinning cat.

One final point: the Eastern concept of levels—physical, astral, mental, Buddhic, Atmic, etc.—is quite real. But these are different levels of consciousness, not the same as the planes described here. When you project astrally, your consciousness doesn't rise—it remains the same as when awake. Only by raising your consciousness can you reach those “higher” levels, and you cannot project into them. That is a different kind of “projection.” I have been to those higher levels, but explaining them is difficult—you must experience them yourself. These levels are typically reached through deep meditation.

To access these higher levels, you need clairvoyance—a faculty that can be developed or may be innate.
